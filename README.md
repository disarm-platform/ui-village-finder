# Village_App

In this folder, I include everything necessary to run the shiny app I wrote to detect villages locations from populated locations. 
Only the Data/ folder is missing as it is too heavy and should be downloaded elsewhere.

App.R is the code for the shiny app and should be run in R.

In the folder Code/ you'll find some code I wrote to process some preliminary data and some algorythmic functions used by the app.

Finally, logo is the Disarm logo for visualization in my app.
